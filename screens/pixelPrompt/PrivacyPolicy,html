    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        Pixel Prompt respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information
        is handled when you use the Pixel Prompt mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Pixel Prompt does not require account registration. The app operates locally on your device
        and does not collect or transmit personal information to our servers. Prompts you view,
        save, and upvote are stored locally on your device only.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Saved Prompts</h2>
    <p>
        Prompts you save are stored in a local database on your device using Room Database.
        This information is never transmitted to any server and remains under your complete control.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Upvotes and Interactions</h2>
    <p>
        Your upvotes on prompts are tracked locally on your device using SharedPreferences.
        This data is used only to reflect your preferences in the app interface.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
        Pixel Prompt displays advertisements using Google AdMob. These services may collect limited,
        non-personal information (such as device identifiers and advertising ID) to show relevant ads.
        This is governed by Google's advertising policies.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Rewarded Ads (Premium Unlock)</h2>
    <p>
        Some premium prompts can be accessed by watching a rewarded advertisement. Watching ads is
        completely optional and requires your explicit consent. After watching an ad, the premium
        prompt is unlocked for viewing on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The app may request permissions for:
        <br>• Internet: To fetch prompts and display ads
        <br>• Device storage: To save prompts locally (if applicable)
        <br>
        All permissions are requested only when needed for app functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties. Third-party services
        (Google AdMob) used by the app operate under their own privacy policies. Your saved prompts
        and upvotes remain entirely on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it. We
        encourage users to protect their devices with appropriate security measures (PIN, password,
        biometric authentication).
    </p>

    <h2>9. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        You can delete any saved prompts from the Saved Prompts screen at any time. Uninstalling
        the app will remove all locally stored data from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Pixel Prompt is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
        personal information from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        This app uses the following third-party services:
        <br>• <strong>Google AdMob:</strong> For displaying banner and rewarded advertisements
        <br>• <strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> For processing in-app purchases (if available)
        <br>
        Please review their privacy policies for more information.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the app or
        applicable laws. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the app's privacy practices,
        please contact us through the Google Play Store listing or at the contact information provided there.
