    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        Shaadi Profile respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information
        is handled when you use the Shaadi Profile mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Shaadi Profile does not require account registration. Any personal information you
        enter (such as name, contact details, photos, or family information) is stored
        locally on your device only.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
        Personal data entered in the app is used solely to create and manage biodata.
        This information is not uploaded to any server and is not accessible to us.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Photos and Storage</h2>
    <p>
        The app may request access to photos or storage only when you choose to add images
        or save generated biodata files. This access is used strictly for app functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
        Shaadi Profile displays advertisements using third-party services such as Google AdMob.
        These services may collect limited, non-personal information (such as device identifiers)
        to show relevant ads.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Rewarded Ads</h2>
    <p>
        Some premium templates or features may be accessed temporarily by watching a rewarded
        advertisement. Watching ads is optional and requires user consent.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Premium Purchase</h2>
    <p>
        Users may purchase a one-time premium upgrade to remove ads and unlock premium features.
        All payments are processed securely through Google Play Billing. We do not collect or store
        payment information.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data. Third-party services used by the app
        operate under their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since data is stored locally on your device, you control its availability and deletion.
        We encourage users to protect their devices with appropriate security measures.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Shaadi Profile is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
        collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Contact</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the
        app’s Google Play Store listing.
